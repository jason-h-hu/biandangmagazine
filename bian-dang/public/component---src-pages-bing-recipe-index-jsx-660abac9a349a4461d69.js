This came from a misunderstanding about the purpose of yeast: Strictly speaking, they aren’t here to directly provide the volume, but rather speckle the dough with billions of microscopic bubbles. In the oven, the sudden vaporization of water and alcohol inflates these bubbles like a balloon, and it’s this steam that provides the volume and lift for the final baked good. Controlling the distribution and size of these bubbles is how we control the final texture. Deflating and folding the dough prevents any uneven gas distribution from fermentation."},{name:"Fill and laminate the dough",description:"Generously brush the sheet of dough with melted shortening, then sprinkle with black pepper and scallions.
