Dough
440 g all-purpose flour
160 g glutinous rice flour
300 g warm water
4 tbsp vegetable oil
4 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp salt
1 tsp dry active yeast yeast

Filling
2 bunches of scallions, white and greens finely chopped
4 tbsp vegetable shortening
2-4 tbs ground black pepper
⅓ cup sesame seeds
1 tsp simple syrup

Step 1. Activate the yeast. 
Mix a couple of spoonfuls of the flour with the yeast, and combine with the hot water to make a thin slurry. Let this sit until bubbles start to form in roughly 10 minutes.

Step 2. Make the dough. 
Combine the slurry with the other ingredients, and then knead the dough by hand for roughly 10-15 minutes, until the dough is very smooth and stretchy. Place the dough inside a lightly oiled work-bowl, large enough to accommodate a doubling in size. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave at room temperature to rise for four hours, or in the fridge overnight. If you’re in a rush, the dough can be set in a very warm spot to complete the rise in as little as an hour and a half.

Step 3. Roll out the dough. 
The dough is ready once it has doubled in size. Punch it down to deflate, and then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. To prepare it for rolling, we need to form the dough into a rough rectangular shape: Flatten it by hand, tri-fold the dough horizontally like a letter, flatten it again, and then finish by tri-folding the dough vertically. 

You’re now ready to roll out the dough: With a large rolling pin, roll the dough to 8” by 24”. The exact measurements don’t matter since the dough will continue to be shaped and stretched  later--just try to keep it a rough rectangle. 

Step 4. Fill and laminate the dough
Generously brush the sheet of dough with melted shortening, then sprinkle with black pepper and scallions. It should seem excessively covered with scallion. Do a horizontal tri-fold to create the layers: All the filling should be enveloped.

Step 5. Shape the bing
With the seam facing down toward the surface, start stretching the dough to its final length. Stretch the dough interval by interval along the length of the dough. Take your time--if the dough feels like it’s going to snap, let it rest for 10-15 minutes to loosen up. The end result should be roughly 42” long. 

Step 6. Finishing touches
Flatten the rolls to be 4” wide and ½” thick: This will define the final dimensions of the bing. Brush the top with the simple syrup, then sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Gently press the seed in with your fingers. Finally, brush on another coat of melted shortening. 

Let the dough rest for 15 minutes before portioning. Trim the two ends if they’re irregular, and then cut the dough into 3” wide bing. Set them on a greased sheet pan with the edges barely touching each other. 

Step 7. Baking
Bake in a 425°F oven on the top shelf for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, and brush the top of the bing with another coat of melted shortening. Return the tray to the oven on the broil setting for 8 minutes, until it has developed a deep, golden color. 

Let it cool for 10-30 minutes before eating.
