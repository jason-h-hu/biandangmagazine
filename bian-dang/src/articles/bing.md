Around the corner from my grandmother’s place in Taipei is a typical breakfast joint. Open for just the morning, it serves up standard fare like fresh soy milk with youtiao. It is fast and cheap for the busy commuter. There are hundreds of Taiwanese breakfast places like it scattered throughout the capital, with even more food carts parked in alleyways and corners, all ready to feed the waking city. Every time I visit, I always order a hujiao bing: a leavened roll, layered with green onion and black pepper. It’s greasy, crispy, and soft--the perfect vehicle for a fried egg.

In the spring of 2020, as the horizon of the pandemic slid from weeks to months to the indefinite future, I decided to recreate this bing in my apartment kitchen. There is, after all, a nostalgic reassurance in the overlap of stress baking and comfort food. Yet when I searched for a recipe online, I found nothing. Instead, I got page after page about another bing of the exact same name. For other people, hujiao bing means spiced pork buns at night markets with family. And damn, these bing looked pretty good: Pulled freshly out of a clay oven, a bite yields succulent filling and a piping hot crust. From Buzzfeed Video to Anthony Bourdain, people were starting to notice, and the internet was awash in praise for these food stalls tucked under the neon signs of the Raohe Night Market. 

Yet my own breakfast bing, the hujiao bing that I remembered, was nowhere to be found. How do you recreate a dish when all you have is your own memory, and a name that points to someone else’s nostalgia?

The duo of sesame and scallions constantly echoes throughout Chinese regional baking, whether in the ubiquitous scallion pancake or the sesame da bing of Muslim Mandarin food. Any combination of “green onion”, “bing”, and “rolls” yields a surprising variety of videos on YouTube, as if the algorithm is procedurally generating scallion-based bings. The landscape of bing could be as big or little, flaky or tender, crispy or chewy as I wanted. Bing is not a discrete dish but a spectrum, and mine was just a dot in this space of textures and memories.

Memories, after all, aren’t photographic recollection, but rather constant creation. For my bing, this would be especially literal. If I couldn’t find a recipe, I would have to create one myself out of the proximal examples. In a video touring a Taipei diner, an old shopkeeper pulls the dough in a long coil, shaping the laminations of spice and onion. On one blog, a recipe for da bing adds rice flour to the dough, to lend chewiness without toughness. On another, a recipe for cong juan brushed the top with simple syrup, to carmelize into a golden brown while baking. The midpoint between all of these yielded something new--an imperfect recreation of the bing at the corner of Nanshan Road--but also something warm, peppery, and familiar.

Hujiao Bing
Yields 12-16
Estimated Time: 1 hours active, 6 hours passive

Dough
440 g all-purpose flour
160 g glutinous rice flour
300 g warm water
4 tbsp vegetable oil
4 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp salt
1 tsp dry active yeast yeast

Filling
2 bunches of scallions, white and greens finely chopped
4 tbsp vegetable shortening
2-4 tbs ground black pepper
⅓ cup sesame seeds
1 tsp simple syrup

Step 1. Activate the yeast. 
Mix a couple of spoonfuls of the flour with the yeast, and combine with the hot water to make a thin slurry. Let this sit until bubbles start to form in roughly 10 minutes.

Step 2. Make the dough. 
Combine the slurry with the other ingredients, and then knead the dough by hand for roughly 10-15 minutes, until the dough is very smooth and stretchy. Place the dough inside a lightly oiled work-bowl, large enough to accommodate a doubling in size. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave at room temperature to rise for four hours, or in the fridge overnight. If you’re in a rush, the dough can be set in a very warm spot to complete the rise in as little as an hour and a half.

Step 3. Roll out the dough. 
The dough is ready once it has doubled in size. Punch it down to deflate, and then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. To prepare it for rolling, we need to form the dough into a rough rectangular shape: Flatten it by hand, tri-fold the dough horizontally like a letter, flatten it again, and then finish by tri-folding the dough vertically. 

You’re now ready to roll out the dough: With a large rolling pin, roll the dough to 8” by 24”. The exact measurements don’t matter since the dough will continue to be shaped and stretched  later--just try to keep it a rough rectangle. 

Step 4. Fill and laminate the dough
Generously brush the sheet of dough with melted shortening, then sprinkle with black pepper and scallions. It should seem excessively covered with scallion. Do a horizontal tri-fold to create the layers: All the filling should be enveloped.

Step 5. Shape the bing
With the seam facing down toward the surface, start stretching the dough to its final length. Stretch the dough interval by interval along the length of the dough. Take your time--if the dough feels like it’s going to snap, let it rest for 10-15 minutes to loosen up. The end result should be roughly 42” long. 

Step 6. Finishing touches
Flatten the rolls to be 4” wide and ½” thick: This will define the final dimensions of the bing. Brush the top with the simple syrup, then sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Gently press the seed in with your fingers. Finally, brush on another coat of melted shortening. 

Let the dough rest for 15 minutes before portioning. Trim the two ends if they’re irregular, and then cut the dough into 3” wide bing. Set them on a greased sheet pan with the edges barely touching each other. 

Step 7. Baking
Bake in a 425°F oven on the top shelf for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, and brush the top of the bing with another coat of melted shortening. Return the tray to the oven on the broil setting for 8 minutes, until it has developed a deep, golden color. 

Let it cool for 10-30 minutes before eating.
