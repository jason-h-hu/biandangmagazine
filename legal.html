You can also choose to have alerts sent to a mobile device that accepts text messages. Changes to your email address or mobile number may apply to your alerts.</p>
				<p>We like to send you alerts because we want you to remember that we know where you are. We can always reach you. We probably know what you're currently wearing, listening to, and eating, and we know how to manipulate that information in order to sell you bigger, better, more expensive commodities. </p>
