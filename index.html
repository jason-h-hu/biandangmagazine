				<h2>About Us</h2>

			<div class="container-fluid">
				<p>DataArbitrage seeks to find holes in the data economy, then to use those holes to restructure the ways in which corporations are using and exploiting your personal information. We earn money by selling our personal data, then use that money to purchase fake social media accounts. The data from the fake social media accounts then is automatically sold, and this new money goes right back into buying new social media accounts! Here's how it works.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container-fluid definition">
				<h3>ar&#149;bi&#149;trage</h3>
				<h4>\'&auml;r-b&#601;-,tr&auml;szh\</h4>
				<p>business : the practice of buying something (such as foreign money, gold, etc.) in one place and selling it almost immediately in another place where it is worth more.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container-fluid">
				<p>Big data is currently one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative industries in the world. Data brokers in the US alone account for a $15 billion industry, all of which rests on the harvesting, analysis, and exploitation of your personal information from platforms across the web. Data brokers know where you live, what you earn, what you like and what you buy--then they use this information to try to push you further into a [capitalist corporate hole], all without your consent or knowledge.</p>
				<p>However, the system is changing. There is currently a growing startup economy of services that let you reclaim partial control of your data, allowing you to aggregate and sell your personal data from across social media platforms as a packet. Access to this data is purchased from you at a weekly rate, then sold to brands, retailers, media agencies, and banks in order to create a more comprehensive set of data profiles. In choosing to sell their personal data, consumers are effectively reclaiming a profit from something that is always already being taken from them.</p>
				<p>At DataArbitrage, we see this developing economy as a space for economic possibility. We earn cash by selling our personal data, then use that money to purchase more social media accounts in large quantities--the data from which we immediately re-sell. In doing so, we expand our presence on the web and our own ability to influence the data pool, utilizing a fundamental flaw in the current data aggregation system: the incredible ease with which one can generate fake profiles and, subsequently, data. LET'S CHECK THE MATH HERE + MAKE IT LEGIT For [only a few dollars], it's possible to purchase hundreds of Facebook and Twitter accounts. And with a weekly payment of $1-2 per account from third-party data brokers, that's a [significant] profit with which to buy more fake accounts. Ultimately, we hope to create an ever-expanding infinite loop of arbitrage, with the end goal of using fake accounts to eventually dilute the entire pool of big data.</p>

				<h3>mission</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="container-fluid">
				<p>We built DataArbitrage within a larger lineage of digital autocannibalism, alongside projects such as <a href="http://www.gwei.org/">Google Will Eat Itself</a>. Like GWEI, DataAbitrage seeks to deconstruct a system of corporate interest and greed by creating a self-destructive loop in which the system, in its continuous search for profit, feeds on and eventually destroys itself.</p>
				<p>Right now, the data industry functions opaquely. We all know that it exists, and we recognize, panoptically, that our presence on social media or online shopping platforms means that our information always has the potential to be surveilled, harvested, analyzed, and used to manipulate our individual web experiences to be as profitable as possible. However, as consumers, we never really see these processes at work: the data brokerage industry, by and large, acts as an invisible middleman between our socially mediated selves and the companies that use those platforms to surround us with personalized advertisements.</p>
				<p>A growing new economy of startup services seek to make the data-aggregation process more transparent: the user is now able to connect their social media information with their purchasing data, providing advertisers with a much more comprehensive understanding of their interests and spending habits. At DataArbitrage, we recognize the value in creating a more transparent and open economy. However, we see this new data-aggregation system as another step forward in a large-scale attempt to normalize the invasive realities of big data. By cashing in on their data as a commodity, consumers are surrendering as complicit in a system that seeks only to profit from details about their private lives. In doing so, we are letting the realities of big data go unquestioned, positioning the act of harvesting our information as natural and normal. </p>

				<h3>Breaking the Economics of Data</h3>
				<p>Through DataArbitrage, we can undermine the value of data, until it becomes to uncertain and to costly for companies to collect and understand. When the cost to collect a terabyte of data surpasses its value, then the data economy will stop running.</p>
				<p>Our analysts have project 2064 as the year we can break the data economy.</p>
